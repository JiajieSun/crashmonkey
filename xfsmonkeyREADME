xfsmonkey is a scrip that lets you run xfstests on crashmonkey.

Then, run the following command, substituting {scratchDevice, scratchDeviceMountPointer, testFile, testName}
	sudo ./xfsmonkey.py --primary-dev TEST -t /dev/scrathDevice /mnt/scratchDeviceMountPoint -e testFile/testName

Make sure you do 'sudo mkdir /mnt/scratchDeviceMountPoint' before executing the command.

Here is an example of the command: 
	sudo ./xfsmonkey.py --primary-dev TEST -t /dev/sdb /mnt/sdbmount/ -e generic/011                # this test runs the generic 011 test
																																																	# to run ext4 tests just do: '-e ext4/001'

By default, the FS is assumed to be of type ext4.

Type "./xfsmonkey --help" to check out the details.
