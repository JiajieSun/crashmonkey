xfsmonkey is a scrip that lets you run xfstests on crashmonkey.

To run xfsmonkey, make sure to put the script such that the directory structure has xfsmonkey.py, crashmonkey, and xfstests in the same directory.
In other words, move xfsmonkey.py up one directory and make sure the xfstests folder is in the same directory.

Make sure xfstests and crashmonkey are both compiled.
Also, make sure xfstests has a local.config file. If unsure, just 'touch local.config'. This file is unncessary for the script, but xfstests requires it.

Then, run the following command, substituting {scratchDevice, scratchDeviceMountPointer, testFile, testName}
	sudo ./xfsmonkey.py --primary-dev TEST -t /dev/scrathDevice /mnt/scratchDeviceMountPoint -e testFile/testName

Make sure you do 'sudo mkdir /mnt/scratchDeviceMountPoint' before executing the command.

Here is an example of the command: 
	sudo ./xfsmonkey.py --primary-dev TEST -t /dev/sdb /mnt/sdbmount/ -e generic/011                # this test runs the generic 011 test
																																																	# to run ext4 tests just do: '-e ext4/001'

By default, the FS is assumed to be of type ext4.
