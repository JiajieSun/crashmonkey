# XFSMONKEYA : xfsmokneya.sh:

xfsmonkeya is xfsmonkey Advanced and it allows you to run xfsmonkey.py for multiple tests sequentially.
It's important to note that this does not run many tests on one instance of crashMonkey (xfsmonkey.py can do that)
Instead it creates many instances of crashMonkey and runs a single xfstest on each instance.

open up xfsmonkey.sh and fill out the config variables at the top to tell it what tests to run and where output should be stored.






xfsmonkey is a script that lets you run xfstests on crashmonkey.

Then, run the following command, substituting {scratchDevice, scratchDeviceMountPointer, testFile, testName}
	sudo ./xfsmonkey.py --primary-dev TEST -t /dev/scrathDevice /mnt/scratchDeviceMountPoint -e testFile/testName

Make sure you do 'sudo mkdir /mnt/scratchDeviceMountPoint' before executing the command.

Here is an example of the command: 
	sudo ./xfsmonkey.py --primary-dev TEST -t /dev/sdb /mnt/sdbmount/ -e generic/011                # this test runs the generic 011 test
																																																	# to run ext4 tests just do: '-e ext4/001'

By default, the FS is assumed to be of type ext4.

Type "./xfsmonkey --help" to check out the details.
